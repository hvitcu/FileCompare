Please find the source code in the attachment.
I have included both my initial train of thought python code and the finished TDD coded java. 
On the first exercise I assumed the initial Tribonacci trio was 0, 0, 1, but changing that should not impact the overall functionality
The second one uses the unit test resource files to test the implementation. The task was rather vague in that it said compare the two files, so I just 
read 1 csv file vs 1 pipe file, and tested scenarious where the files were the same and different.
I have tried naming the methods and classes as clearly as I could to make the could readable and require as little comments as possible.

Coverage is 100% on both projects. 
I used TestNG for the multithreaded testing capabilities, as well as the nl.jqno.equalsverifier.EqualsVerifier
to test that the equals and hash methods have been correctly overridden/implemented.
I would have parameterized the test for the first Exercise but that would not be as readable and would not show my TDD approach.
Also the second test class in that exercise is there to simulate calls from different clients.
